# [BandAmp 2.9](https://bandamp.fly.dev/)

Bandcamp music player with a queue.

## Reasoning behind the project

Bandcamp doesn't let you play multiple albums in a queue.
I didn't like it, so I fixed the problem the only way I know: with some good ol' PHP, HTML, CSS and JS.

## Contributing

I see this project as feature-complete. I might add a thing or two occasionally.

If you are willing to contribute to the project, be my guest! Make forks, implement features, make pull requests.
